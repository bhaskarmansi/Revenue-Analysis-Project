# Revenue-Analysis-Project

 In this guided project, our goal is to simulate the revenue analysis process for AtliQ Grands, a fictional company operating in the hospitality industry. Through this project, I explored revenue optimization strategies and gained valuable insights to help AtliQ Grands improve their market share and revenue performance in the luxury/business hotels category.

**Project Objectives**

The primary objective of the AtliQ Grands Revenue Analysis project is to demonstrate the process of revenue analysis and provide strategic recommendations to improve market share and revenue performance. By analyzing simulated historical data, we aim to identify key revenue drivers, uncover trends, and develop actionable strategies that can be applied to real-world hospitality businesses facing similar challenges.
